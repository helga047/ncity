        <h1>History of NC Clan</h1>
        <br></br>


<p>
I spoke to Fabian and it's his part of the story:
</p>
<br></br>
<p>hist
The NC Clan was founded on <strong>January 22, 2008</strong>. At that time, many clans were short-lived, 
but the idea behind this one was different: to create a friend group that would never disappear. Just called it â€” <em>"No Clan"</em>.
</p>

<p>
What set the clan apart was its foundation in <strong>friendship</strong>. 
Thanks to this, it quickly grew in popularity and became a lasting home for some members. 
Over the years, NC members created more than <strong>30+ custom levels</strong>.
</p>

<p>
At first, the group was only a handful of people. But soon, 
the <em>No Clan</em> reached an impressive milestone of <strong>70+ members</strong>.
